Three Capstone Project Proposals - Laura D. Rose 5.6.17

1. A problem at my company is accurately forecasting demand for certain pharmaceutical products. I’ve looked at the top SKU contributors to our forecast variance over the past six months and realize that if we could improve forecast accuracy with a better model(s) for one or more of these SKUs, we could improve overall forecast accuracy by about at least five percent. My data sources for this project would be company demand and shipment data and government source (probably CDC) flu data as an explanatory factors such as lagged demand, size of a large customer’s recent order etc. The flu data would need to be collected or aggregated at the monthly level because the demand data would be at this level. At this point, I think that a linear regression model of some type would be helpful for this data, given that it is continuous. Potential issues with this project are relevant explanatory variables and obtaining an NDA from the company.

2. I work in supply chain, so predicting product backorder is helpful to the company. Kaggle.com has a dataset involving predicting product backorder: https://www.kaggle.com/tiredgeek/predict-bo-trial This would be an opportunity to employ logistic regression or other techniques beyond the standard linear regression.

3. I work for a pharmaceutical company, so the opiate overdose epidemic is a topic of concern. The following dataset on Kaggle is related to predicting opiate overdoses based on opiate prescripions by prescribing doctor, drug, etc. https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions At this point, I would guess that the data could be modeled with a linear regression, but I’m concerned that could be too simplistic. It’s a fairly complex dataset with many drugs and prescribers. Determining how to model this accurately could be outside of the scope of this workshop and may be a project for a more advanced workshop.
